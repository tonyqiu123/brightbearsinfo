                        <h6>Intro</h6>
                        <p>When graduating high school, most students tend to care about their grades and getting into good universities, colleges or workplaces. However, many students overlook essential skills that help them succeed in those departments. These are known as transferable skills, and they are abilities or talents that can be applicable in any job or career. They can include both “hard” skills (e.g. programming) and “soft” skills (e.g. leadership), and are developed through working both inside and outside of class. Through active participation within class, you develop problem solving skills. Likewise, through volunteering or joining clubs, you demonstrate active cooperation.</p>

                    <div class="blogParagraph column">
                        <h6>Why are transferable skills important?
                        </h6>
                        <p>To do well in post-secondary or at your job, you will have to know people’s expectations of you, skills to conduct yourself, and practice teamwork with your employers, colleagues, and peers. This will simultaneously improve your progress in school, work, and life. When applying for jobs, it is beneficial to include transferable skills in your resume and cover letter. Having these skills is desirable for employers, as it portrays your practical capabilities to solve problems, exercise leadership, and collaborate with your team. Including your transferable skills will show that you are able to go beyond your job description, take on challenges, and are valuable to the workplace. Whether or not you are applying to a position that is in a different industry from where you previously worked, transferable skills will always help you to adapt and grow in your career. Your job is to recognize these skills in yourself, and to develop, demonstrate, and market them in a manner that will lead you to your desired career.</p>

                        <h6>The 11 essential transferable skills
                        </h6>
                        <p>Although all transferable skills are valued in most platforms, there are 11 essential transferable skills that all high school graduates should have before graduating. These skills are...</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Communications Skills:</span>You should know how to talk, listen, and interact with peers and colleagues to learn and share thoughts and information.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Adaptability:</span>When working at new places, many things seem different such as the work environment, the colleagues, the type of work, and the atmosphere. Going to post-secondary especially is a huge shift in students’ lives, thus you need to acquire skills to help you deal with change, stay positive, learn a variety of new tasks, and persevere in order to strive.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Collaboration:</span>The ability to respectfully work with others and people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, cultures, and nations to create a positive work environment. You should also be capable of appreciating everyones thoughts and ideas within a group.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Creativity:</span>Creative skills include coming up with unique solutions to challenges, thinking outside the box, being curious and imaginative, and finding superior strategies and techniques to complete tasks. Employers in particular seek creativity in their employees as it broadens perspective, thus being a creative thinker can make you a more appealing candidate for a job. Creativity is also an essential part of designing projects and writing assignments at post-secondary.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Digital (tech) Skills:</span>In this modern and technological society where almost everything we do involves and correlates with technology, being able to use it efficiently is a huge asset. It is fundamental to have the necessary skills to use digital technologies like computers, phones, social media, the internet and virtual meeting platforms (especially during pandemics like COVID-19)</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Numeracy Skills:</span>As a graduating high schooler it is absolutely critical to understand and effectively use mathematical information like numbers, symbols, basic formulas, graphics and handling money, to complete tasks like budgeting.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Problem Solving:</span>While working at any place whether it is university/college, or at your job, problems and tough situations will arise, it is inevitable. One should know how to identify challenges/problems, detect and execute a solution, and evaluate whether or not the situation has been resolved.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Reading:</span>You should be able to read words and use symbols in addition to pictures to research and communicate data.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Writing:</span>You should be able to write words, sentences, letters, emails, and reports professionally and effectively. You should have the capability to share your thoughts through words, pictures, and images.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Critical Thinking:</span>As a critical thinker one can thoroughly analyze facts and arguments, obtain evidence, make observations to form an educated opinion or judgment.</p>
                        <p class="blogBulletPoint"><span>Time Management and Organization:</span>“Procrastination is the foundation of all disasters.” ~ Pandora Poikilos. As a high school student myself, I have procrastinated so much and left every assignment for the last minute. However, it was not until grade 11, that I realized that starting your work early can actually make you much less stressed. Time management helps you prioritize tasks that need to be completed so that you have enough time to complete other projects and work. In post-secondary, courses are very fast-paced, and as a result, you have to stay on top of everything which requires impressive organization and time management skills. You can do so by creating schedules, setting goals, increasing productivity through prime-time (according to your body clock), preparing in advance, making a plan, etc.</p>

                        <h6>Advice from BrightBearInfo leaders
                        </h6>
                        <p>Lingshan, one of the co-founders of BBI, shares her story of transferable skills that helped her run the organization successfully:</p>
                        <p class="blogQuote">“When I first co-founded BrightBearsInfo, I spent hours brainstorming ways to avoid having contact with the public. To cut a long tale short, it is difficult to create or run a non-profit organization, or any organization for that matter, without pushing yourself to develop your communication skills. At the end of the day, the success of your organization is defined by how successfully you meet the needs of your audience. Taking advantage of every opportunity to speak with your audience is critical to the organization's success. Without effective communication skills, none of this would have been feasible. To build such skills, I have found that sharing my organization's story with new people is the best place to start. New connections, relationships, and partnership opportunities will result from this effort”.</p>
                        <p>Faith, the Head of Research, also describes her opinion on crucial transferable skills everyone should have. She mentions organization and leadership as skills that she found most beneficial while asserting that “these skills ensure that our department can consistently run in a smooth and orderly manner”. “Communication skills (written, verbal, listening, etc) are valuable as well to allow ideas, updates, and research findings to be expressed clearly”, she further states.</p>

                        <h6>Opportunities to develop transferable skills
                        </h6>
                        <p>These skills can be developed in various ways, ranging from academic to extracurricular activities. Dan Li, Head of Marketing at BrightBearsInfo says the following:</p>
                        <p class="blogQuote">"Joining clubs, sports teams, and researching part time jobs and internships are all excellent ways to develop and refurbish such skills. Throughout my junior years, balancing weekly practices, games, and meetings alongside courses enabled me to optimize the hours spent doing each task. Not only did this boost my collaborative skills but also my reading, writing, and critical thinking skills by a great margin. Amalgamating involvement in sports and in academics will allow one to capitalize on improving habits in the academic field. Subsequently, opportunities in volunteering and working are effective ways to develop practicality. Throughout these experiences in Grade 12 I learned to adapt to a variety of realistic situations, and to work at a pragmatic and efficient standard. These skills would smoothly transition into future internship and employment opportunities."</p>
